          The default shell in some versions of macOS is Bash, and
	  Bash is available in all versions, so no need to install anything.
	  You access Bash from the Terminal (found in
	  <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).
          See the Git installation <a href="#shell-macos-video-tutorial">video tutorial</a>
          for an example on how to open the Terminal.
          You may want to keep Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
        </p>
        <p>
            To see if your default shell is Bash type <code>echo $SHELL</code>
            in Terminal and press the <kbd>Return</kbd> key. If the message
            printed does not end with '/bash' then your default is something
            else and you can run Bash by typing <code>bash</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to change your default shell, see <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT208050" rel="noopener">
          this Apple Support article</a> and follow the instructions on "How to change your default shell".

          The default shell is usually Bash and there is usually no need to
          install anything.

          To see if your default shell is Bash type <code>echo $SHELL</code> in
          a terminal and press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key. If the message printed
          does not end with '/bash' then your default is something else and you
          can run Bash by typing <code>bash</code>.

  <h3>Git</h3>
  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported
    web browser</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will need an account at <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>
    for parts of the Git lesson. Basic GitHub accounts are free. We encourage
    you to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
    Please consider what personal information you'd like to reveal. For
    example, you may want to review these
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/">instructions

          Git should be installed on your computer as part of your Bash
          install (see the
          <a href="#shell">Shell installation instructions</a>).

          <strong>For macOS</strong>, install Git for Mac
          by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer from
          <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">this list</a>.
          Because this installer is not signed by the developer, you may have to
          right click (control click) on the .pkg file, click Open, and click
          Open on the pop up window.
          After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
          as Git is a command line program.
          <strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)</strong> use the
          most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard"
          <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">available here</a>.

        <p>
          If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to
          install it via your distro's package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run
          <code>sudo apt-get install git</code> and for Fedora run
          <code>sudo dnf install git</code>.
