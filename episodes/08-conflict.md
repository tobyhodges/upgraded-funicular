title: Conflicts
teaching: 15
exercises: 0
questions:
- "What do I do when my changes conflict?"
objectives:
- "Explain what conflicts are and when they can occur."
- "Understand how to resolve conflicts resulting from a merge."
keypoints:
- "Conflicts occur when files are changed in the same place in two commits that are being merged."
- "The version control system does not allow one to overwrite changes blindly during a merge, but highlights conflicts so that they can be resolved."

As soon as people can work in parallel, they'll likely step on each other's
toes.  This will even happen with a single person: if we are working on
a piece of software on both our laptop and a server in the lab, we could make
different changes to each copy.  Version control helps us manage these
[conflicts]({{ page.root }}/reference/#conflicts) by giving us tools to
[resolve]({{ page.root }}/reference/#resolve) overlapping changes.

To see how we can resolve conflicts, we must first create one.  The
file `mars.txt` currently looks like this in our `planets` repository:

~~~
$ cat mars.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
~~~
{: .output}

Let's create a new branch for discussing Mars' temperature and
checkout that branch.

~~~
$ git branch marsTemp
~~~
{: .bash}

But before we make changes related to Mars' temperature,
let's add a line to Mars.txt.

~~~
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
I'll be able to get 40 extra minutes of beauty rest
~~~
{: .output}

and commit that change to the `master` branch

~~~
$ git add mars.txt
$ git commit -m "Add a line about the daylight on Mars."
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
[master 5ae9631] Add a line in our home copy
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
~~~
{: .output}

Now that we're done with that, let's get to work on our comments about
the temperature in the `marsTemp` branch.

~~~
$ git checkout marsTemp
$ git branch
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
* marsTemp
  master
~~~
{: .output}

Let's make a note in `mars.txt` about the temperature

~~~
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
Yeti will appreciate the cold
~~~
{: .output}

Now let's commit this change to the `marsTemp` branch

~~~
$ git add mars.txt
$ git commit -m "Add a line about the temperature on Mars"
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
[master 07ebc69] Add a line in my copy
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
~~~
{: .output}

Great, now that we've added changes about the temperature
we can merge them into the `master` branch. First, let's checkout the
`master` branch.

~~~
$ git checkout master
$ git branch
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
  marsTemp
* master
~~~
{: .output}

And then merge the changes from `marsTemp`

~~~
$ git merge marsTemp
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
On branch master
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)

  both modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

~~~
{: .output}

![The Conflicting Changes](../fig/conflict.svg)

Git detects that the changes made in one copy overlap with those made
in the other and stops us from trampling on our previous work. It also
marks that conflict in the affected file:

~~~
$ cat mars.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
<<<<<<< HEAD
I'll be able to get 40 extra minutes of beauty rest
=======
Yeti will appreciate the cold
>>>>>>> dabb4c8c450e8475aee9b14b4383acc99f42af1d
~~~
{: .output}

Our change is preceded by `<<<<<<< HEAD`.
Git has then inserted `=======` as a separator between the conflicting changes
and marked the end of the content downloaded from GitHub with `>>>>>>>`.
(The string of letters and digits after that marker
identifies the commit we've just downloaded.)

It is now up to us to edit this file to remove these markers
and reconcile the changes.
We can do anything we want: keep the change made in the local repository, keep
the change made in the remote repository, write something new to replace both,
or get rid of the change entirely.
Let's replace both so that the file looks like this:

~~~
$ cat mars.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
We removed the conflict on this line
~~~
{: .output}

To finish merging,
we add `mars.txt` to the changes being made by the merge
and then commit:

~~~
$ git add mars.txt
$ git status
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
On branch master
All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)

Changes to be committed:

	modified:   mars.txt

~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ git commit -m "Merge changes from marsTemp"
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
[master 2abf2b1] Merge changes from marsTemp
~~~
{: .output}

Git keeps track of what we've merged with what,
so we don't have to fix things by hand again. If
we make another change to the `marsTemp` branch

~~~
$ git checkout marsTemp
$ echo "The polar caps will probably be Yeti's home" >> mars.txt
$ git add mars.txt
$ git commit -m "A note about Yeti's home"
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
[master 34avo82] A note about Yeti's home
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
~~~
{: .output}

And merge that change into master

~~~
$ git checkout master
$ git merge marsTemp
~~~

~~~
Updating 12687f6..x792csa1
Fast-forward
 mars.txt | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
~~~
{: .output}

There is no conflict and our changes are added automatically

~~~
$ cat mars.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
We removed the conflict on this line
The polar caps will probably be Yeti's home
~~~
{: .output}

We don't need to merge again because Git knows someone has already done that.

Git's ability to resolve conflicts is very useful, but conflict resolution
costs time and effort, and can introduce errors if conflicts are not resolved
correctly. If you find yourself resolving a lot of conflicts in a project,
consider these technical approaches to reducing them:

- Pull from upstream more frequently, especially before starting new work
- Use topic branches to segregate work, merging to master when complete
- Make smaller more atomic commits
- Where logically appropriate, break large files into smaller ones so that it is
  less likely that two authors will alter the same file simultaneously

Conflicts can also be minimized with project management strategies:

- Clarify who is responsible for what areas with your collaborators
- Discuss what order tasks should be carried out in with your collaborators so
  that tasks that will change the same file won't be worked on at the same time
